# Aeroacoustics_Cylinder-Vortex-Shedding
Validation test case for OpenFOAM's Curle analogy implementation and libAcoustics Curle and FW-H analogy implementation. 
The results are compared with experiments and numerical simulations done by Chen et al. (2023). 
Aerodynamics and aeroacoustics results are well aligned with the FW-H analogy.
For more information, please refer to my MS thesis, which is also available on my GitHub page.
